        <h1>San Francisco: the best and the worst</h1>
        <h2>Inner Richmond</h2>
        <p>
            Along the growing popularity of entertainment of <strong>Clement St.</strong>, everyone comes together every night of the week for events held at the local bars and venues like <em>Neck of the Woods</em> and <em>Richmond Republic</em>. You can walk from Arguello down to Park Presidio and enjoy so many <strong>types of foods and markets</strong>, and everything is in a short walking distance from each other! It is a block over from Geary Blvd and public transit reaches the evergrowing events of the <em>Inner Richmond</em>.

        <h2>South of Mission/Geneva Ave.</h2>
         <p>
                Though there are many areas of the city that, if not aware of the past few years, can be more <strong>"dangerous"</strong> than others, Geneva Ave. has been a battle of <strong>broken streets, home invasions and gun-point robbery</strong>. Even with light out, the area is known for unneccessary confrontations with muggers and gang members. Though residents of the area continue to thrive there, <em>it isn't a place I'd be any time of day</em>.

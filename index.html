            <h2>VMD 105 Digital Skills for Visual Media</h2>

            <p>
                This work showcases the amazing knowledge I gained from the class and I’m excited you came through! My interest and background is Graphic Design and I took the class to refresh my skills with the Adobe programs used here. I really have fun creating 2D graphic elements, especially vector-based characters and scenes, and the Animate project allowed me to bring my world to life! I enjoyed the confidence I gained from each project and now, I want to continue building my cast of sappy bananas for people to enjoy! :D
